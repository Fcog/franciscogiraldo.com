## Project Overview
When working at El Pais S.A., I was in the team assigned to modernize this Classifieds web application. 

## Objectives

The whole website was revamped with a more modern and minimalistic design provided by the internal design team. 

The design HTML and CSS was handed to the development team where we decomposed it into reusable UI components. 

## Challenge

The project had high code complexity. The app was initially created as a generic ads system so the Backend and the Frontend codebase was huge with many modules. 

The system was created by an external company so none of the internal Developers could support or guide us. 

And Extra care was needed so no new bugs were introduced.

### Main epics: 

#### Change the User Interface of the Ads product detail page.

New modern elements were added: 
- New images slider with thumbnails
- Collapsible sections
- Modern icons

The Search Page UX was improved by adding more untuituve filtering widgets and adding image slides to each of the individual search results.

#### Improve the User Experience when a user uploads an Ad.

The old multi-step form to upload an Ad was replaced with a single intuitive and easy to use form with collapsible sections with an accordion effect.
