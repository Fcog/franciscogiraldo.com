## Project Overview
The client needed a new website that had an online form where their own clients could submit a form. At the same time, the client wanted to update their internal business system.

He also wanted that this multi-step form could be easily editable from the backend.

\
&nbsp;
## The Challenge
We had to choose the correct tech to build the multi-step form and to handle the client's internal system.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
## The Approach & Solution
Unfortunately, this was not the case of a sucessful project. We chose WordPress so that we could easily create the multi-step form with a 3rd party plugin, but WordPress fails when creating 
advanced system with many entities and relationships.

The multi-step form was done, but the internal system was not reliable and quickly the system data got messed up with wrong information.

This project was clearly a job for a more robust tool: a framework like Laravel or Django.
