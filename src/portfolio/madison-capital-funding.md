## Project Overview
Content oriented project created with flexible reusable blocks.
\
&nbsp;
\
&nbsp;
## The Challenge
This website had many types of content but nothing to difficult that WordPress couldn't handle. 

The client also wanted content to fade in as the user scrolled down to the content.
\

\
&nbsp;
## The Approach & Solution
Most of the functionality was created using WordPress' basic setup, plus the creation of many custom post types.

CSS animations were used to trigger the necessary animations.
