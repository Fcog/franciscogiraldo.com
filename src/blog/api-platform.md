## Installation

``composer require api``

http://localhost:8080/api

 API Platform's philosophy is this: create some resources, tweak any configuration you need - we haven't done that, but will soon - and let API Platform expose those resources as an API. It does that, but to be an extra good friend, it also creates an OpenAPI specification. Check it out: go to /api/docs.json.

## Swagger

## OpenAPI specification

Is a format for describing APIs. Gives all information about an Entity to the API.

## JSON-LD

Adds extra fields to the json endpoint that describes the data.

@id @type

## RDF (Resource Description Format)
