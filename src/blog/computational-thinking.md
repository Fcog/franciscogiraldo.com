This are the 4 pillars to approach problems more systematically, developing more efficient solutions, and understanding how computers can be used in the problem solving process.

Computational thinking involves using concepts from computer science to develop solutions to problems. But it also involves expressing those solutions in such a way that they can carried out by a computer. 

## Decomposition
Decomposition is the process of taking a complex problem and breaking it into more manageable sub-problems.
You can also consider a sub-problem as another complex problem and further decompose.

## Pattern Recognition
When we decompose the problem, we frequently find patterns among the sub-problems, i.e., similarities or shared characteristics. Discovering these patterns make the complex problem easier to solve since we can use the same solution for each occurrence of the pattern. 
We use pattern recognition in solving everyday problems such as repetitive drawing tasks or mulching a garden.

## Data representation and abstraction
Data representation and abstraction involves determining what characteristics of the problem are important and filtering out those that are not. From this, we can create a representation of what we're trying to solve. Information is important may vary depending on the task objective. 

## Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions of how to solve a problem. It identifies what is to be done (the instructions), and the order in which they should be done.
