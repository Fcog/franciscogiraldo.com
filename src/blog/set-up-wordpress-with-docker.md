## Overview of Docker Compose
[Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) is a tool for defining and running multi-container [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose) applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
