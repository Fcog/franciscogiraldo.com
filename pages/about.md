Hi! my name is Francisco Giraldo. I'm a **Web Developer** from Cali, Colombia.

I have **8 years of experience** working for companies doing Web Development and more than 20 years experimenting with websites since I had my first computer when I was 14 years old. The good old days of Frontpage and fancy color websites and animated gifs!

Nowdays, my main working experience resides in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) advanced development.

But I also like to learn new technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), or the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)

## My work with WordPress
As as Web Developer I have used **WordPress like a programming framework** rather than the usual plugins/themes install/configuration approach.

I use a bare bones theme for developers called the [Lean Theme](https://github.com/wearenolte/lean-theme) for creating custom websites. 

I also rely heavily on the use of the [Advance Custom Fields plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) to create the backend data structure and the Gutenberg blocks of a website.
